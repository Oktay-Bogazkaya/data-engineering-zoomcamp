## Week 1 Homework PartB

This homework is to check that you have installed and deployed Terraform.

## Question 1: Enter the Output Displayed After Running Terraform Apply

Run the command to get information on Docker

>Proposed Command:
```
terraform apply -var="project=gentle-presence-375809"
```

Output:

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
